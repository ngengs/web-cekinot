# WEB CEKINOT
***

YOu can now fducking save your fducking ceki score wherever/whenever you are, whether there's internet coverage or not (BE FUCKING SMART! YOU NEED TO ACCESS THIS WEB WITH 4-FDUCKING-Gs FULL BAR SIGNAL OR 500GBPS WIFI COVERAGE ONCE, BEFORE BEING ABLE TO ACCESS IT OFFLINE), on Android / iOS / Desktop browser (preferably browser which uses webkit or chromium engine such as google chrome or safari).

IMPORTANT NOTE: if you still insist to use internet explorer to open this app with, just go ðŸ˜Š FUCK YOURSELDF!!!!


### Code Pre-Requisites
1. Install Node fucking JS ( version >6 )
2. Install bower globally with npm
3. Do ````npm install```` on your terminal/command prompt
4. Do ````bower install```` on your terminal/command prompt


### Structure
* .tmp/ : temporary files used by gulp to serve / God knows
* app/ : the one that you are getting laid with
* dist/ : don't even fucking touch it
* bower.json : you put bower dependencies in it. Since this is a simple web app, you'd better use bower for the dependencies rather than npm to reserve the file size. Unless you really want to mess with Node
* package.json :  npm thingy


### Gulp commands
Tbh, I don't fucking know how that gulpfile.js works. This app scaffolded with yeoman. If you think you know better than me, just tell me (I'll leave my email somewhere). These are several gulp commands I use:
1. ````gulp clean````
to clean dist directory (production ready code)

2. ````gulp serve````
to serve the app, so you can see it yourself

3. ````gulp````
yeah, just fucking gulp. to bundle all the necessary stuffs and put it in dist directory
